Run all Go tests with verbose output.

Run: `cd /Users/lukasvavrek/Developer/hackathon-team-vavrek-warriors && go test -v -count=1 ./...`

If any tests fail:
1. Read the failing test and the code under test
2. Identify the root cause
3. Fix the code (not the test, unless the test itself is wrong)
4. Re-run tests to confirm the fix
